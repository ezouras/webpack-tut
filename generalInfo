https://webpack.js.org/
Bundle all javascript files into one file indentifed in the html file
thru the script tag.  it just needs that one file to build the app.

thru imports and exports, javascript will know how to build the files
and webpack will know how to add them to one file.



1/ bundle code
2/ manage dependencies.
  need certain files to load first that are dependent on other files

3/ default entry point for webpack is "index.js" in the src directory
  Error you will receive when running webpack:
  ERROR in main
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './src' in 'C:\SoftwareProjects\git\personalStuff\Webpack'

* add index.js in "src" folder


  4/ in package file:
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack"
  },

  >npm start

  will create, by default, a dist folder with a main.js file.
  everything from index.js will go into main js.
  if you bring up the webpage and click on "sources", you will see
  that everything other than the css and html is in ONE js file called "main.js"
  in the dist folder

  5/ to change default behavior (read index.js from src folder or output in main.js in dist folder)
  you need to create a webpack config file
  in this project we named this file 'webpack.config.js' but yo can call it
  whatever you want

  6/ in your package file you need to tell webpack to use
  the config file:
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack --config webpack.config.js"
  },

  7/ If you change the output file using the webpack config file, be sure
  to change the script file in the html file

  8/ Mode is set to "production" by default so the minified file is
  impossible to understand.  to change this,
  add mode:"development"
  in the webpack config file

  9/ to make it even more readable (git rid of "eval") set
  devtool (lowercase t) to none:
  module.exports = {
    mode: "development",
    devtool: false,
    entry: "./src/index.js",
    output: {
      filename: "main.js",
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist")
    }

  10/ the way webpack handles files other than javasript (css, pictures) is
  thru loaders  . please read the "loaders" file

  11/ installed bootstrap
  npm install --save-dev bootstrap
  Then you can remove from the html file, the import statement for bootstrap
  see "bootstrap" file for the rest
