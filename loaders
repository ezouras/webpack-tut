https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/#example

1/ install the type of loader (depending on the file) you need.
example we will use here is .css
ie' we want webpack to handle and bundle the stylesheets

a/ install the following:
pick the loder from this file and follow instructions:
https://webpack.js.org/loaders/

npm install --save-dev style-loader
https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/
npm install --save-dev css-loader

2/ in your webpack config file,
you need to tell webpack which modules require which loaders
Here is the basic frame:
module: {
  rules: [

  ]
}

a/ here is the exact rule:
module.exports = {
  mode: "development",
  devtool: false,
  entry: "./src/index.js",
  output: {
    filename: "main.js",
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist")
  }
  module: {
    rules: [{
      test: /\.css$/i,
      use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],
    }, ]
  }

  it is using "regex" where /regex/
  \. =  escape used so that it reads the dot
  .css$  = use the loader on anything ending in .css

  3/ whatever your "entry" file is (it is index.js in our case -
  look at the html to know which one in yours; that file should match up
  with whatever you have in the webpack config file),
  import the .css file you want to use
